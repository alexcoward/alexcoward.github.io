## Homebrew Package Manager

<!--break-->

If you have not heard of Homebrew before. Please read on for a quick intro to what 
is, in my opinion, probably the best package manager available for macOS!!  

### What does homebrew do? 

Homebrew is a open source package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Appleâ€™s macOS operating system. Homebrew
can of course also easily manage the update and removal of software installed using the brew command.

Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.

It is important to note that Homebrew is written in the Ruby programming language and targets the version of Ruby that
comes installed with the macOS operating system, which may be different than the latest version of Ruby.... 


### Homebrew Use Case

Well, you could use Homebrew to install multiple programs on your macOS for example:

* nginx - A well known web server
* xctool - A tool for building xcode projects
* certbot - A tool to obtain certs from Let's Encrypt and autoenable HTTPS
* fastlane - A tool to build and release mobile apps

Then you can manage these programs using brew, such that when you need to update the programs, you can do so usually with two simple commands.

A complete list of programs available via Homebrew are available here [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)
