Fiddled around with docker today and completed the CIT160 lab.

<!--break-->

I found that the docker toolbox was the easiest way for me to use docker on Windows,
it was nice beacuse it used VirtualBox to create a unix based virtual machine 
that convienantly had all the binaries installed that i need to complete the lab
(git, ssh, etc.).

I first installed the CIT160 container on my laptop using scp - built the container,
and next created a container named cit160 and mounted it a folder on my laptop for
easy access to files inside the container.

{% highlight ruby %}

scp <UID>@ssh.sandbox.csun.edu:~steve/cit160/etc/dockerfile . // Grab the dockerfile from ~steve/...
docker build -t cit160 etc // Build the container image
docker create --name cit160 --interactive --tty \ 
              --volume ~/cit160:/mnt/laptop-cit160 cit160 // Create the container and mount point

{% endhighlight %}

I learned some very nice commands for future use in the docker environment.

{% highlight ruby %}

docker start <container name> // To start a container
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash // To start a bash shell on a container
docker stop <container name> // To stop a container
docker exec -it <container name> login // To login into a container as a regular user
docker ps -a // List all containers


{% endhighlight %}
