So my group of two begain project0 this week and we either began or accomplished the following tasks
I will only briefly list items as you may visit our repo/website to see the action items for yourself!

### How's the project coming along?

1: Setting up GitHub repo

2: Setting up GitHub project (two week sprint)

3: I got us a domain name from freenom.com

4: Set up our EC2 Instance

5: Added A record's to Route53 for our website

6: Setup IAM to allow group members to connect to the server without sharing ssh keys

## Some helpful commands I learned

1: You can add these lines of code to your virtualhost file to permanently redirect users to the HTTPS version
of your website using the apache2 rewrite module

{% highlight ruby %}

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =teamaerialcsun.gq [OR]
RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =www.teamaerialcsun.gq
RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]

{% endhighlight %}

2: You must enable the rewrite module however or apache2 will fail to load

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo a2enmod rewrite

{% endhighlight %}

3: I also learned that you can setup Ansible to push a ssh public key to a GitHub secrets repo this will essentially
allow you to automate cloning the private repo 

{% highlight ruby %}

- name: add a new read-only deploy key to a GitHub repository using basic authentication
    github_deploy_key:
      owner: ""
      repo: ""
      name: ""
      key: "/path/to/generated/privatekey"
      read_only: yes
      username: ""
      password: ""
      otp: "" // a six digit one time code

{% endhighlight %}
