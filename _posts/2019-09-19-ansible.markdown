## Completed lab2 and created my first Ansible playbook.

<!--break-->

This was my first programmatic experience with Ansible, despite hearing about
Ansible from work colleagues.

### I learned some very useful stuff!

1: Array variables can be declared with the following syntax

{% highlight ruby %}

core_packages: ['traceroute', 'sudo', 'vim', 'git', 'curl', 'zip', 'apache2', 'mysql-client', 'software-properties-common', 'ansible']
php_packages: ['php', 'libapache2-mod-php', 'php-mysql', 'php7.2-cli', 'php7.2-curl', 'php7.2-gd', 'php7.2-mbstring', 'php7.2-mysql', 'php7.2-xml']
	
{% endhighlight %}

2: Arrays' may be accessed by the following syntax:

{% highlight ruby %}

"{{ "{{ core_packages " }}}}"
"{{ "{{ php_packages " }}}}"
	
{% endhighlight %}

3: Lists' in Ansible are declared like this 'with_items' and accessed though "{{ "{{ item " }}}}":

{% highlight ruby %}

- name: add users to cit480
    user:
       name: "{{ "{{ item " }}}}"
       groups: cit480
       state: present
    with_items:
       - bob
       - jimmy

{% endhighlight %}

4: Ansible has some pretty cool modules we can use in our playbook to help automate deployments to our hosts.

{% highlight ruby %}

 apt: to manage package installation
 copy: to copy files
 group: to add groups
 user: to add users
 file: to modify file attributes such as ownership
 lineinfile: to add text to a file
 apt_repository: to add a new repo to apt-get
 git: to clone git repos
 shell: to execute commands in the shell on the remote host
 service: to manage system services on a remote host (start or stop a service)
 
{% endhighlight %}

## Some helpful info about the ansible-playbook command

{% highlight ruby %}

ansible-playbook [options] playbook.yml [playbook2 ...]

----------------flags------------------

--syntax-check | to check the syntax of the yml file
--check | donâ€™t make any changes; instead, try to predict some of the changes that may occur

{% endhighlight %}
