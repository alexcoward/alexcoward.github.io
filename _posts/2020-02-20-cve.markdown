## About CVE's

<!--break-->

Whether you are using Nessus Security Center to scan a network for vulnerabilities, or using open source libraries on Github
it is important to know a little but about CVE's....

Common vulnerabilities and exposures, or a CVE for short are unique, common identifiers for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities 
in publicly released software packages.

CVE's are contained in a system which is currently maintained by the MITRE Corporation.

CVE's have several important attributes among them are;
* Entry Creation Date (The date the entry was created)
* CVE-ID (The unique ID for the vulnerability)
* Assigning CNA (An organization that can assign and announce CVE entries within a particular scope)
* Description (A brief explanation of the vulnerability)
* Reference (Usually a link to additional information on the vulnerability, which may include workarounds, etc.)

### How can we find more information about a CVE?

1: We can go to MITRE's CVE website which maintains the database of CVE's. Here you would need to input the name of the CVE to see more info,
[https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org)

*Example to search for a known Microsoft Internet Explorer CVE
[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0674](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0674)


2: We can call a REST API. The nice things about this API is that it gives you alot of data including possible solutions.

{% highlight ruby %}

curl https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/CVE-2020-0674

{% endhighlight %}

3: We can check open source code on GitHub for GitHub Security Advisories. Click on the "Security" tab at the root of the repository.
* Remember though, this is only useful if the repository owner has reported the security advisory...

*Example to search all advisories 
[https://github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories)

*Example of an advisory 
[https://github.com/dojo/dojox/security/advisories](https://github.com/dojo/dojox/security/advisories)

### A few things can we do to mitigate our exposure due to CVE's?

Develop a security policy to among other things:

1: Keep your software and operating systems up to date and patched  
2: Limit your systems exposure to attackers  
3: Scan your system for vulnerabilities regularly (Nessus Essentials is a great tool for home use) [https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials)
