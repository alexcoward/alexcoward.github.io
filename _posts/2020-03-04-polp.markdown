## The Principle Of Least Privilege

<!--break-->

In this blog post I will explain a little bit about the principle of least privilege and how we can apply the principle to a Linux process,
(Confluence in this example). 

Simply put, the Principle Of Least Privilege states that, each part of the system (a program or a user) should be given only the privileges it needs to 
perform its normal duties and nothing more. That way, if one part of the system is compromised, the damage will be limited.

Many programs run on non-privileged ports (or ports > 1023) thus, many of these processes do not need to be running with root permissions.

One such program is Confluence as it runs on port 8090. A dedicated user should be created to run Confluence, because Confluence runs as the user it is invoked under 
and therefore can potentially be abused. 

The general process to allow a program to run with non root permissions is as follows:
* Create a dedicated system user account who will run the process and own the files needed by the process
* Change permissions of the folders/files needed by the process
* Start the process from the dedicated system user account

### Confluence Running As A Service (Non-Root) 

1: First we need to create a system user account for a "confluence" user


{% highlight ruby %}

sudo /usr/sbin/useradd --create-home --comment "Account for running Confluence" --shell /bin/bash confluence

* Optional:
// We may also create a group called confluence as well
sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd confluence

// Add the confluence user to the group
sudo usermod -aG confluence confluence

{% endhighlight %}


2: Next we need to change the permissions of the confluence home folder and the installation folder

{% highlight ruby %}

// Change ownership of Confluence home directory recursively 
chown -R confluence /var/atlassian

// Change mode of Confluence home directory recursively to allow user read, write and execute permissions and remove groups and others access
chmod -R u=rwx,go-rwx /var/atlassian

// Confluence installation folder recursively
chown -R confluence /opt/atlassian

// Change mode of Confluence home directory recursively to allow user read, write and execute permissions and remove groups and others access
chmod -R u=rwx,go-rwx /opt/atlassian

* Optional:
// Change the group of the folders as well
chgrp -R confluence /opt/atlassian
chgrp -R confluence /var/atlassian

{% endhighlight %}

3: Verify folder permissions using ls -al

{% highlight ruby %}

// Installation Directory: /opt/atlassian/confluence
drwx------ 14 confluence root 4096 Feb 20 17:34 confluence

// Home Directory: /var/atlassian/application-data/confluence
drwx------ 3 confluence root 4096 Feb 20 17:34 application-data

{% endhighlight %}

4: Start Confluence from the /opt/atlassian/bin folder as our "confluence" user

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo su confluence 

./start-confluence.sh

{% endhighlight %}

5: Use ps -ef to verify process running as non-privileged user, you should now notice the "user" column for the 
Conluence process should indicate "confluence" vs. "root".
