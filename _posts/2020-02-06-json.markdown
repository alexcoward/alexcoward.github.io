## Static JSON Files

<!--break-->

Often times you may need to host some static files online that need to be accessed and used by some application.
However, maybe you don't want to host your own web-server. Well enter AWS S3 or Amazon's Simple Storage Service!
With S3 we can:
* Easily host our static content 
* Get a web addressable reference to out static content
* Generate a custom object ACL for items in our S3 bucket (public access or private access)

### How To Host A JSON In A S3 Bucket

1: First, we need to create our bucket

{% highlight ruby %}

Log into the AWS console
Go to S3 service
Click create bucket
Give your bucket a unique name
You will want to turn OFF block all public access if you want external applications to access files in your bucket


{% endhighlight %}

2: Now we need to create our JSON file (for simplicity I have provided one below) This JSON has an array of 6
of my favorite websites. The JSON object favoriteWebsites contains an array of 6 objects, each with a name and url key value pair.
We can name our file favoriteWeb.json for example

{% highlight ruby %}

{
  "favoriteWebsites": [
    {
      "name": "Google",
      "url": "https://www.google.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Youtube",
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "eBay",
      "url": "https://www.ebay.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "WranglerForum",
      "url": "https://www.jlwranglerforums.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Amazon",
      "url": "https://www.amazon.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Reddit",
      "url": "https://www.reddit.com"
    }
  ]
}


{% endhighlight %}

3: Now we upload our file (favoriteWeb.json) to the S3 bucket we just created above using the file picker. Making sure that we allow public
READ access only for our file permissions. After uploading we will get a nice URL to access our JSON file.

{% highlight ruby %}

https://alexjsontestbucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/favoriteWeb.json

{% endhighlight %}

4: Next, we can test our endpoint in our browser

[https://alexjsontestbucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/favoriteWeb.json](https://alexjsontestbucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/favoriteWeb.json)

5: Now we can parse elements of the JSON using a loop to grab our favorite websites
* In Python

{% highlight ruby %}

import urllib.request, json

with urllib.request.urlopen("https://alexjsontestbucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/favoriteWeb.json") as url:
    data = json.loads(url.read().decode())
    for website in data['favoriteWebsites']:
        print(website['url'])
		
Output from above code:

https://www.google.com
https://www.youtube.com
https://www.ebay.com
https://www.jlwranglerforums.com
https://www.amazon.com
https://www.reddit.com
		
{% endhighlight %}
