## Hi There, today I got Jekyll up and running with a non default theme. 
<!--break-->
### It was quite annoying I must say, primarily because of the modifications needed to support a new theme.

#### Eventually I got it up and running but here are some of the issues I saw:

1. Had to resolve conflicting dependencies in my gem file.

2. Had to clean installed gems.

3. Had to change layout titles to match the new theme 'page', 'post' and 'home'.

4. Had to downgrade the Jekyll plugin to 3.8.5 from 4.0.0.

5. Had to update gems.

6. Had to create a _layout folder.

7. Had to create template HTML files for blog posts, etc.

8. Had to add an _includes folder with a sample navigation yml file to reuse across the website.
