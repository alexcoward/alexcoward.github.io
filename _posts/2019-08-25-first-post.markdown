Hi There, today I got Jekyll up and running with a non default theme. It was quite annoying I must say,
primarily because of the modifications needed to support a new theme.

Eventually I got it up and running but here are some of the issues I saw:

{% highlight ruby %}
Had to resolve conflicting dependencies in my GEM file.

Had to change layout titles to 'default'.

Had to downgrade the Jekyll plugin to 3.5.
{% endhighlight %}
